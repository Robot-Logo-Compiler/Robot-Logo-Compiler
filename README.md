# Robot-Logo-Compiler

## Application purpose

Robot-Logo-Compiler is a tool that enables the use of a Logo programming language to control and instruct LEGO MINDSTORMS® robot toys that operate on the LeJos operating system written in Java. 

As with any compiler, this compiler translates the higher-level Logo programming language into a lower-level language of Java. In other words, it provides a layer of abstraction that hides all of the impelemntation details of the lower-level language. 

The primary purpose of this compiler is to provide educational assistance for children learning programming.
