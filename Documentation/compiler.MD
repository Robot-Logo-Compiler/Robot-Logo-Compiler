# Compiler

The working principle behind the current implementation of a Logo-compiler consists of several sequential subtasks that are performed after one another. The compiler as a whole is comprised of auxiliary programs, which form the group of individual subcomponents of a compiler named in accordance with the tasks that they perform (lexer, parser, semantic analyzer, code generator).

The overall work flow is visualized in the picture below:
